# Face-Mask-Detection
This project uses Keras, Tensorflow, MobileNet, and OpenCV to create a Face Mask Detector. This project makes use of a live video camera. These types of models could be connected with CCTV cameras in the future to detect and identify persons without masks.
To begin the project, you must first extract the dataset file, train and test the dataset, and build a graph plot, after which we will define the mask using video.
